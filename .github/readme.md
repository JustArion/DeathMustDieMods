A small collection of mods I've made for the game `Death Must Die` using the [BepInEx](https://github.com/BepInEx/BepInEx) mod loader.

### New to Mods Install Guide

Firstly, welcome!

1. We need to install a mod loader for our mods to get into the game. In our case, we will be using **BepInEx**.
BepInEx can be downloaded from [here](https://github.com/BepInEx/BepInEx/releases/download/v6.0.0-pre.1/BepInEx_UnityMono_x86_6.0.0-pre.1.zip).

2. Extract **everything** inside the `.zip` file into your game's folder.
> [!NOTE]
> [How to find your game folder](https://savelocation.net/steam-game-folder)

3. In your game folder open the `BepInEx` folder and make another folder called "plugins" (your mods will go in there)

3. Head over to [DeathMustDieMods Releases](https://github.com/JustArion/DeathMustDieMods/releases/latest) and choose some mods to download (Available under the **Assets** dropdown)

4. Download the mods you want to the game folder's `\BepInEx\plugins\` folder you extracted and made from step 2.

5. Start the game and enjoy some mods!

If you have any issues, don't hesitate to submit an [issue](https://github.com/JustArion/DeathMustDieMods/issues) and I will respond as soon as possible.

### Those who used BepInEx before
Simply move the mod's .dll into your game's `\BepInEx\plugins\` folder and the mod should load fine.
